# Convoy Mesh — continuity

## STATUS

**0.7.7-exp1+9 experimental pedestrian candidate**, [draft PR #4](https://github.com/Arduino89/convoy-mesh/pull/4), `experiment/pedestrian-acquisition-v1`. **149/149 CI tests pass**. [Android run #121](https://github.com/Arduino89/convoy-mesh/actions/runs/37198612027), attempt 1, **SUCCESS** for both build and emulator jobs. Exact APK bytes, source and signature independently verified; automated delivery gate passed. Physical two-phone evidence pending. No production or merge approval.

User authorized implementation, branch, commits, draft PR and build on 2026-10-03, replacing the earlier read-only phase. Fix demonstrated acquisition/cadence defects first; preserve provider/5 s request/BLE/HISTORY. Do not restart from main or PR #3.

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

Nearby: native BLE without continuous GNSS/FGS. Map preview: location without outing track. Outing: GNSS/track plus native foreground owner. Source freshness, UI time and radio presence remain separate. HISTORY ACK/retry is bounded and never overwrites live position.

Estimator: static consensus plus majority-supported moving acquisition; first/reacquired points do not add trail. At most 26 time bins within 25 s. Motion evidence prefers 20 s, using the existing 25 s window when fewer than five observations are present. No provisional publication. IMU alone cannot authorize large unsupported innovations. Classifier unchanged; service test clock defaults to DateTime.now in production.

Diagnostics remain independent of outing lifetime, local and capped at four minutes. Process-loss outing reconstruction is still absent.

Experimental distribution: native GitHub Releases, fixed tag `experimental-latest` and asset `Convoy-Mesh-Experimental.apk`; a separate versioned prerelease preserves each promoted APK. The branch-local `.github/workflows/experimental-download.yml` explicitly selects an approved successful CI run/source/hash, validates and publishes existing bytes. No automatic publication of ordinary builds, rebuild or signing change.

## CANONICAL SOURCES

- [README](README.md): current install/artifact checkpoint and fixed download URL.
- [Experimental download](https://github.com/Arduino89/convoy-mesh/releases/tag/experimental-latest); `.github/workflows/experimental-download.yml`: reviewed distribution, archived version and byte verification.
- [Experiment rationale, measured limits and field protocol](docs/pedestrian-exp1.md).
- [Synthetic CSV](docs/pedestrian-exp1-results.csv); regenerate with `ConvoyMeshApp/tool/pedestrian_candidate_probe.dart`.
- `ConvoyMeshApp/test/`, `.github/workflows/android-debug.yml`, `tools/android_smoke.sh`: actual estimator/service and APK/emulator evidence.
- PR #1 continuity at `c3ef471` retains older milestone details; this is the current handoff, not another changelog.

## STABILIZED DECISIONS

Cama authorized public experimental APK distribution with one fixed download link on 2026-10-06. Reuse-first level 4: native GitHub Releases/Actions; no website, account service or updater added. Promote only an explicitly reviewed candidate; versioned archive assets are not overwritten. Keep DRAFT/no merge. The debug signing limitation remains; fixed URLs do not guarantee Android update compatibility.

Walking/hiking only, offline BLE, no road/origin snapping. Uncertainty overlap does not prove identical position; RSSI is not metres. Do not compare clocks across phones. No ledger/GATT/CoC/fusion-library/rendering changes here. Real logs and coordinates stay private.

Previous candidate untouched on `fix/v0.4-stability` / PR #1: **0.7.6+8**, executable `3e056f88ab44a4fbb9989058a9191e2bebc3cba4`, run #105 `34701227901`, SHA-256 `6fd9baa63e41e62259ac8d11db9993b034605625c91be478b3f51ee594fbc3f8`. Automated gates passed, physical hardening pending. Old APK artifact expired; retain copies/installs.

Experiment installs beside it as `com.example.convoy_mesh.pedestrianexp1` / **Convoy Mesh Exp**. Separate permissions/identity/data; only one app active per phone. No uninstall needed. Old certificate unavailable and debug keys not retained: future upgrade compatibility must be verified. Uninstall deletes local data.

## COMPLETED

- `7248589`: shared estimator regressions/probe. Baseline: 122 pass/19 fail; all 107 original tests pass.
- `be04599`: bounded temporal evidence and supported moving acquisition; independent irregular-interval/minority counterexamples included.
- `d0d6818`: service tests and isolated clock; preview/freshness/segments/log lifetime covered.
- `8ab7c06`: isolated version/package, SDK/dependency pins, signature checks and stronger smoke.
- `844e3a9`: short-gap support; recovery metric requires new support, not just an unexpired old anchor.
- Candidate: 147/147 passed locally and in run #120; all 149 pass in run #121 after two real-service regressions were added. Analyzer completed with the same 21 nonfatal findings.
- Independent replay matched all 18 run #120 outing observations without Android lifecycle. The slow synthetic stimulus, not GPS suspension, reproduced the missing trail; no production threshold was lowered.
- `9ca9107`: ordinary GPS-walk smoke with a positive screen-on control, post-sleep diagnostic boundary, strict fresh-trail/source-motion assertions, plus reliable quiet-IMU ordinary-walk and isolated-jump service tests.
- Run #121 built/tested exact source `9ca9107f229af91354116278c9970b39d0a4e81e`; signature/package/version/minSDK 24/arm64 checks and API35 emulator passed. Post-sleep GPS 14 -> 28 and trail 4 -> 18; all 14 new points fresh over 69.01 s / 86.52 m. Resume, preview isolation and diagnostic survival after outing stop passed.
- Reconstructed APK matches CI and emulator SHA-256 `9737bf12b116a4321f0e7a54f9b09b1d0e13ff0c95e682aba3ba0d9b793dba11` / 164,372,655 bytes. Independent signed-content/RSA verification passed. Keep the exact delivered APK; README holds install identity.

## CURRENT WORK

**Isolated telemetry LAB / draft PR5 — full sender verified locally, 7 November2026.** Exact executed source `50386a5c8ce5b0cf628073989a0eaf1549008e79`, wrapper `21938337ca1ac00ecd35697d16f592a62fa7477e`; [run42389745788 / number17 / attempt1 / job128454627737](https://github.com/Arduino89/convoy-mesh/actions/runs/42389745788/job/128454627737) SUCCESS.

[Current evidence, APK identity, independent reviews and offline recalculation](docs/telemetry-evidence/2026-11-07/full-sender-local/README.md). No newSDK/server/endpoint/integration. Fixedloopback, fake token, fresh emulator, no cloud configuration/credentials; radio/defaultnetwork barriers and stopLAB/removeADBroute before radio restoration. Independent source, concrete workflow and runtime reviews passed. Original workflow restored byte-identically at b3bfaf8 and independently verified on GitHub; final receipt commit changes documentation only, no new Android source/execution. This proves real HTTP/InputStream/UTF8 behavior locally, not TLS/PostHog storage or physicalphone behavior. Earlier33functionfixtures remain historical; they were reused rather than reexecuted.

**Cloud remains separate and unauthorized.** Historical run15/source809caf:20actuallyreceived/0ACK/queue100, exact responsebodyunknown; no cloud revocation/newconsent/retry/dedupe proof. No old20 reloaded/retried. Prior prudential700closed, currentfutureallowance0. Convoy unchanged; no merge/release/integration/paidservice/realusers. Application field checkpoint remainsREADME/PR4.

## NEXT GATE

Review full local evidence and the [non-executing cloud proposal](docs/telemetry-evidence/2026-11-07/full-sender-local/cloud-proposal.md):160new event-transmissions maximum (130nominal+30margin), only after separate Cama approval and reviewed new gate700+160=860. Oldunused180 and old20 retries remain excluded. No cloud execution from this closure. Phones/battery/GNSS/BLE remain separate subsequent gates.

## DO NOT

No merge of PR #4 or #1. No old main/ledger base. Do not present old APK as improved. Do not promise zero drift and zero lag from indistinguishable inputs, metre-level accuracy, lossless HISTORY or guaranteed force-stop survival. Do not invent lines across missing history. Do not touch Cama-Enterprise, Sagre, NUC/Bridge or shared workers.

## OPEN RISKS / DEBT

- Automated screen-off evidence now passes for ordinary injected walking; very slow walking/quiet IMU and real GNSS/BLE/OEM behavior are not certified by it.
- GPS-only 0.3 m/s/accuracy 10 m still misses track movement; synthetic fresh error reaches 24 m.
- Tight curves/returns defeat net/path; coherent drift is observationally ambiguous. Exact cadence invariance is unproven; gain remains per sample.
- Acquisition is heuristic, not calibrated confidence. No physical accuracy/battery benefit measured.
- HISTORY loss/retry, OEM/deep Doze, endurance and process-loss recovery need physical evidence; identity/colour convergence remains separate.
- Original lock was incomplete. New lock matches all 76 versions recoverable from old CI logs; no old APK byte-reproducibility claim.
- Debug signing and analyzer/deprecation debt remain.

## CLEANUP PENDING

No automatic removal of branches/builds. Keep the exact delivered APK; CI retention is finite 90 days. Superseded intermediate CI runs are not candidate identities. No public/private-log duplication.

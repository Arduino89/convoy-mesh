# Convoy Mesh — continuity

## STATUS

**0.7.7-exp1+9 experimental pedestrian candidate**, [draft PR #4](https://github.com/Arduino89/convoy-mesh/pull/4), `experiment/pedestrian-acquisition-v1`. **149/149 CI tests pass**. [Android run #121](https://github.com/Arduino89/convoy-mesh/actions/runs/37198612027), attempt 1, **SUCCESS** for both build and emulator jobs. Exact APK bytes, source and signature independently verified; automated delivery gate passed. Physical two-phone evidence pending. No production or merge approval.

User authorized implementation, branch, commits, draft PR and build on 2026-10-03, replacing the earlier read-only phase. Fix demonstrated acquisition/cadence defects first; preserve provider/5 s request/BLE/HISTORY. Do not restart from main or PR #3.

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

Nearby: native BLE without continuous GNSS/FGS. Map preview: location without outing track. Outing: GNSS/track plus native foreground owner. Source freshness, UI time and radio presence remain separate. HISTORY ACK/retry is bounded and never overwrites live position.

Estimator: static consensus plus majority-supported moving acquisition; first/reacquired points do not add trail. At most 26 time bins within 25 s. Motion evidence prefers 20 s, using the existing 25 s window when fewer than five observations are present. No provisional publication. IMU alone cannot authorize large unsupported innovations. Classifier unchanged; service test clock defaults to DateTime.now in production.

Diagnostics remain independent of outing lifetime, local and capped at four minutes. Process-loss outing reconstruction is still absent.

## CANONICAL SOURCES

- [README](README.md): current install/artifact checkpoint.
- [Experiment rationale, measured limits and field protocol](docs/pedestrian-exp1.md).
- [Synthetic CSV](docs/pedestrian-exp1-results.csv); regenerate with `ConvoyMeshApp/tool/pedestrian_candidate_probe.dart`.
- `ConvoyMeshApp/test/`, `.github/workflows/android-debug.yml`, `tools/android_smoke.sh`: actual estimator/service and APK/emulator evidence.
- PR #1 continuity at `c3ef471` retains older milestone details; this is the current handoff, not another changelog.

## STABILIZED DECISIONS

Walking/hiking only, offline BLE, no road/origin snapping. Uncertainty overlap does not prove identical position; RSSI is not metres. Do not compare clocks across phones. No ledger/GATT/CoC/fusion-library/rendering changes here. Real logs and coordinates stay private.

Previous candidate untouched on `fix/v0.4-stability` / PR #1: **0.7.6+8**, executable `3e056f88ab44a4fbb9989058a9191e2bebc3cba4`, run #105 `34701227901`, SHA-256 `6fd9baa63e41e62259ac8d11db9993b034605625c91be478b3f51ee594fbc3f8`. Automated gates passed, physical hardening pending. Old APK artifact expired; retain copies/installs.

Experiment installs beside it as `com.example.convoy_mesh.pedestrianexp1` / **Convoy Mesh Exp**. Separate permissions/identity/data; only one app active per phone. No uninstall needed. Old certificate unavailable and debug keys not retained: future upgrade compatibility must be verified. Uninstall deletes local data.

## COMPLETED

- `7248589`: shared estimator regressions/probe. Baseline: 122 pass/19 fail; all 107 original tests pass.
- `be04599`: bounded temporal evidence and supported moving acquisition; independent irregular-interval/minority counterexamples included.
- `d0d6818`: service tests and isolated clock; preview/freshness/segments/log lifetime covered.
- `8ab7c06`: isolated version/package, SDK/dependency pins, signature checks and stronger smoke.
- `844e3a9`: short-gap support; recovery metric requires new support, not just an unexpired old anchor.
- Candidate: 147/147 passed locally and in run #120; all 149 pass in run #121 after two real-service regressions were added. Analyzer completed with the same 21 nonfatal findings.
- Independent replay matched all 18 run #120 outing observations without Android lifecycle. The slow synthetic stimulus, not GPS suspension, reproduced the missing trail; no production threshold was lowered.
- `9ca9107`: ordinary GPS-walk smoke with a positive screen-on control, post-sleep diagnostic boundary, strict fresh-trail/source-motion assertions, plus reliable quiet-IMU ordinary-walk and isolated-jump service tests.
- Run #121 built/tested exact source `9ca9107f229af91354116278c9970b39d0a4e81e`; signature/package/version/minSDK 24/arm64 checks and API35 emulator passed. Post-sleep GPS 14 -> 28 and trail 4 -> 18; all 14 new points fresh over 69.01 s / 86.52 m. Resume, preview isolation and diagnostic survival after outing stop passed.
- Reconstructed APK matches CI and emulator SHA-256 `9737bf12b116a4321f0e7a54f9b09b1d0e13ff0c95e682aba3ba0d9b793dba11` / 164,372,655 bytes. Independent signed-content/RSA verification passed. Keep the exact delivered APK; README holds install identity.

## CURRENT WORK

Deliver the verified experimental APK for Cama/Francesca's physical trial. Run #120 diagnosis is complete: ~0.44 m/s with reliable quiet IMU gives only ~8.9 m over 20 s, below the existing 10 m GPS-motion gate. Run #121 corrected the smoke to ordinary walking and passed stronger assertions without changing the application thresholds. Historical runs #118/#119 were cancelled by later pushes; run #120 failed. Original Work execution/error telemetry remains unavailable, so its chat interruption cause is unverified.

## NEXT GATE

Use the three existing Cama/Francesca sessions in `docs/pedestrian-exp1.md`, each below four minutes, on Mi9Lite/API29 and M2101K6G/API33. Confirm both logs show 0.7.7-exp1+9 / `9ca9107`, preserve private exports and annotate failures. Field evidence precedes accuracy claims or merge; no need to rerun the passed automated gate unless executable changes or new counterexamples warrant it.

## DO NOT

No merge of PR #4 or #1. No old main/ledger base. Do not present old APK as improved. Do not promise zero drift and zero lag from indistinguishable inputs, metre-level accuracy, lossless HISTORY or guaranteed force-stop survival. Do not invent lines across missing history. Do not touch Cama-Enterprise, Sagre, NUC/Bridge or shared workers.

## OPEN RISKS / DEBT

- Automated screen-off evidence now passes for ordinary injected walking; very slow walking/quiet IMU and real GNSS/BLE/OEM behavior are not certified by it.
- GPS-only 0.3 m/s/accuracy 10 m still misses track movement; synthetic fresh error reaches 24 m.
- Tight curves/returns defeat net/path; coherent drift is observationally ambiguous. Exact cadence invariance is unproven; gain remains per sample.
- Acquisition is heuristic, not calibrated confidence. No physical accuracy/battery benefit measured.
- HISTORY loss/retry, OEM/deep Doze, endurance and process-loss recovery need physical evidence; identity/colour convergence remains separate.
- Original lock was incomplete. New lock matches all 76 versions recoverable from old CI logs; no old APK byte-reproducibility claim.
- Debug signing and analyzer/deprecation debt remain.

## CLEANUP PENDING

No automatic removal of branches/builds. Keep the exact delivered APK; CI retention is finite 90 days. Superseded intermediate CI runs are not candidate identities. No public/private-log duplication.

## LAST CHECKPOINT

2026-10-04: user authorized corrections, verification and delivery. Recovered PR #4, reproduced all 18 failed-run outing fixes independently, corrected only the ordinary-walk smoke scenario and added two actual-service regressions. Run #121 attempt 1 passed all 149 tests and both Android jobs. Exact source `9ca9107`, APK/hash/signature and post-sleep receipts checked; APK retained for handoff. This checkpoint is documentation only. No merge or physical validation; chat/UI interruption cause remains unverified.
